	* Notes for this new release-0.8.2:

	Now HDFS output path is customizable for group files into hourly,
	daily, monthly or annually.

	The nomenclature version rationale is
	the following:

	The camus consumer is linked with the Kafka version 0.8, and this
	version of camus consumer is the "version 2". So the tag is named
	"release-0.8.2". The last number will change with new version
	of this producer, and the two first numbers only will be changed
	with the mayor version of Kafka.
