		<description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node

		<description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node 
		    should store its blocks. If this is a comma-delimited list of directories,
		    then data will be stored in all named directories, typically on different
		    devices. Directories that do not exist are ignored. This property specifies 
		    the directories where the DataNode stores blocks. The recommendation is 
		    that you configure the disks on the DataNode in a JBOD configuration, 
		    mounted at /data/1/ through /data/N, and configure dfs.datanode.data.dir 
		    to specify /data/1/dfs/dn through /data/N/dfs/dn/.</description>
